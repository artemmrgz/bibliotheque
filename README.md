## Description
Bibliotheque is a simple app which allows users to explore new books, add/remove them to/from reading list and keep track of books that are currently saved and ones that have been read. To find their next book, user can either check New York Times Bestseller list or simply search by author or title.

Technologies used:
* CoreData: to save books user would like to read;
* Networking(URLSession): for retrieving data using iTunes books and New York Times APIs;
* MVC pattern;
* Unit testing
